{"name":"OpenState-SDN","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to OpenState SDN project.\r\n\r\nOpenState is a research effort focused in the development of a stateful data-plane API for Software-Defined Networking. We propose an extension to current OpenFlow abstraction that use state machines implemented inside switches to reduce the need to rely on remote controllers. To know more about our project you can read our first paper:\r\n\r\n> G. Bianchi, M. Bonola, A. Capone, and C. Cascone, “OpenState: Programming Platform-independent Stateful OpenFlow Applications Inside the Switch” ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, vol. 44, no. 2, pp. 44–51, 2014. [[PDF]](openstate-ccr.pdf) [[BibTex]](openstate-ccr.bib).\r\n\r\n### Try OpenState\r\n\r\nTo try OpenState features you first to run our custom version of Mininet.\r\n\r\nThe following commands have been tested in a clean **Mininet v2.1.0** VM. For download and help running Mininet please refer to <http://mininet.org/>\r\n\r\n1) Update Mininet install scripts in order to download and configure OpenState switch/controller. Inside Mininet shell type the following commands:\r\n\r\n    cd mininet\r\n    git remote add openstate https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/mininet.git\r\n    git pull openstate master\r\n\r\n2) Install OpenState switch/controller with the following options:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./util/install.sh -n3fy\r\n\r\nThe command above will run Mininet installer including OpenState softswitch and controller in only one shot!\r\n\r\n3) Check out some [OpenState sample applications](https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/ryu/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Repositories\r\n\r\n_OpenState switch_\r\n[https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/ofsoftswitch13](https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/ofsoftswitch13)\r\n\r\n_OpenState controller_\r\n[https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/ryu](https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/ryu)\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n[Marco Bonola](https://github.com/marcobonola), [Carmelo Cascone](https://github.com/ccascone), [Hanieh Rajabi](https://github.com/haniehrajabi)","google":"UA-51960380-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
