{"name":"OpenState-SDN","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to OpenState SDN project.\r\n\r\nTo try OpenState feature you need to run our custom version of Mininet.\r\n\r\nThe following commands have been tested in a clean **Mininet v2.1.0** VM. For download and help running Mininet please refer to <http://mininet.org/>\r\n\r\n1) We need to update Mininet install scripts in order to download and configure OpenState switch/controller. Inside Mininet shell type the following commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n    cd mininet\r\n    git remote add openstate https://github.com/OpenState-SDN/mininet.git\r\n    git pull openstate master\r\n\r\n\r\n2) We can now install OpenState switch/controller with the following options:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./util/install.sh -n3fy\r\n\r\nThe command above will run Mininet installer including OpenState softswitch and controller in only one shot!\r\n\r\n3) All set here.
